<p>George lucas thought that the scene between <strong>Han Solo</strong> and Greedo in the cantena, made Han look cold blooded. let's think of the original scene shall we? Greedo the bounty hunter is holding Han at gun point and say in his gargly voice he is going to kill him. Han shoots Greedo through the table before Greedo can blow han a new smuggling hatch. That maked Han <em>cool</em>, not cold.</p>
